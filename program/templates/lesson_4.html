        <h3>Applications of Javascript Programming:</h3>
        <p>As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has its presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validating those inputs at the front-end itself.</li>
            <li>Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML pages on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modifying your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.
            </li>
            <li>User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.
            </li>
            <li>Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
            </li>
            <li>Presentations - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives the website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build web-based slide presentations.
            </li>
            <li>Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.</li>
